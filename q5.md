## Question 5 - Basic SQL

Please consider the following:

```php
$place = "Jimmy's Place";
$sql = "INSERT INTO place(name) VALUES('{$place}')";
$this->db->query($sql);
```
Is this going to be valid, or will it produce an error?
And if there is an error, what is it and how can it be fixed?

The string in $place contains special character so the $sql expression won't be properly parsed.
Instead, we might use prepare statement with paramether:

```php
$place = "Jimmy's Place";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO place(name) VALUES (?)");

if($stmt){
  $stmt->bind_param('s', $place);
  $stmt->execute();
}else {
  echo $stmt->error;
}

```
